We would rather see:  clean readable code that does not do everything it is supposed to, ugly websites that work well, unfinished projects accompanied by a well thought-out study plan to cover the concepts that held you up, a buggy project where you tried something challenging or experimental, code you understand and can explain, ... than code that works but is ugly and you don’t understand.  \n\nLearning pace:  We expect that everyone will move through the weekly projects at the same rate; Weekly.  If you are moving faster than the others, come to us and we will help you expand on this week's projects rather than moving you ahead to next week. \nThe lectures are likewise built to match this scheme.  All lectures will be high-level treatments of their subjects.  Their principle goal will be to (hopefully) introduce the ‘why’ for the next tool or skill in the curriculum right around when you’re getting annoyed by not having it.  Lectures will be highish level presentations of new topics - they are designed to be beneficial if followed with only a pencil and paper. It will be up to you to master the subjects that are most important or interesting for you.  Afternoon code reviews will be the chance to discuss implelementation.This is for a few reasons:1) Ya’ll learn at different paces and in different ways. (from experience) Initial technical introductions are too slow for some, to fast for others, and not helpful for the rest.  We have provided you with study guides and links to the best learning resources we could find or create for each topic.2)  To keep everyone as together as possible, we are introducing new topics first at a conversational level of understanding.  The hope is even if the programming takes some of you longer to master, that won’t keep you from participating .  You will have the diagrams and vocabulary necessary to think about each topic and participate in discussions while your coding skills catch up.\n\nStudy:  We expect you all to work outside of class time.  We simply can’t teach all of you everything, it is up to you (and us, through one-on-ones) to decide what you will learn on your own and what we’ll help you with, what you'll master and what you'll leave for later.  For some of you this may mean we have private study sessions in syntax, for others it might mean we have daily coding challenges prepared for you.  The importance is that you work enough outside of class so you come ready to take in the day’s new concepts and come prepared with something concrete we can help you with (a bug you couldn’t fix, a finished mini-project you want help refactoring, a list of questions, a topic you’d like to talk about, …).\n\nRMC:  Read, Modify, Create.  We recommend you proceed in this order.  We’ve done our best to provide you with a variety of good code samples pertaining to each topic.  If you need help with the M after finishing the R, come to us.  We can help by providing addon challenges, refactor challenges, by introducing good bugs, or deleting portions of code. RMC also plays out over the course of the whole program.  If you have trouble creating programs from scratch, there is no shame in your first projects being entirely of the M category.  RMC is also nice for practice reading.  You’ll spend far more time reading code than writing it in your life.\n\n\n"},"phases/ph1-frontend-and-devving.html":{"url":"phases/ph1-frontend-and-devving.html","title":"Part 1 - frontend, devving","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1 -  Developer Skills and JavaScript\nThe first part of this course is designed to be a backend agnostic introduction to software and web development all in JavaScript. \nTopics covered:\n\nAlgorithms -\nwhat are they?\nData Structures\nrecursion\n\n\nApp Design -\nApp = data + interaction\nMVC\nData Modeling basics\n\n\nDeveloper Skills -\nReading/writing specs or documentation\nWriting user-friendly codebase\nOrganizing your GitHub account\nOrganizing your development process\n\n\nFrontend -\nHTML and CSS fundamentals\nDOM basics\n\n\nJavaScript -\nfundamentals\nOOP basics -\napps as objects\ninheritance with classes\nmodeling wiht objects\n\n\nfunctional basics - \npure functions\nclosures 101\n\n\nasync 101\n\n\nNode.js as ...\nJS runtime \nbuild environment for front-end apps\n\n\nTesting -\nvanilla unit tests\nvanilla test suites\ntesting paradigms\n\n\nTools -\nCLI\nNode\nGitHub\nNPM\nChromeDev\nGulp+babel\n\n\n\n"},"weeks/01-foundations.html":{"url":"weeks/01-foundations.html","title":"w1 - foundations","keywords":"","body":"Week theme:  common groundworks\nWeek learning objects:  \n\nCreate comprehensive GitHub repositories   \nplan, test, document your exercises    \nGet to know your classmates and teachers  \nSet up your machines  \nFamiliarity with basic git workflow  \n\nLectures:\n\nMonday  \n\nwelcome presentation \nBe Prepared! \nInitial one-on-one meetings   \nCli  \nInstallations   \nNode-1   \nGit and Github  \n\n\nTuesday\n\nGit\nFunctions   \nEnglish to JS\n\n\nWednesday  \n\nGithub repos   \nObjects-1  \nWriting specs\n\n\nThursday \n\nScope Context   \nGithub portfolio  \nsimplest passing functions and testing 101\n\n\n\nProjects:\n\nBegin your GH portfolio  \ncleancalc 0-2\n\n"},"weeks/02-apps-101.html":{"url":"weeks/02-apps-101.html","title":"w2 - apps 101","keywords":"","body":"Week theme: apps = data + interaction  \nLearning Objectives:  \n\ngit branching  \nBegin thinking in User Stories  \nBasic understanding of the DOM \nPrimitive debugging techniques  \nUsing objects as apps  \n\n\nMonday  \n\nBrowsers \nCss  \nHtml  \nDOM-1  \nChromdev  \n\n\nTuesday  \n\nOop-1  \nMVC\n\n\nWednesday  \n\nData Modeling-1  \nReadable Code \n\n\nThursday  \n\nProgramming Languages  \nDebugging  \n\n\n\nProjects:\n\nticatactoes 1  \nBattleship\nReconstruct a landing page  \n\n"},"weeks/03-js2-and-algorithms.html":{"url":"weeks/03-js2-and-algorithms.html","title":"w3 - JS 2, algorithms","keywords":"","body":"Week theme: Next level JS and algorithms  \nLearning Objectives:  \n\nWhat are algorithms?  \nWhat is inheritance, how do classes do it?  \nRecursion  \nAsynchronicity  \nHow to model with inheritance  \nWhat are data structures?  \n\n\nMonday   \n\nOop-2 Classes  \nInheritance\n\n\nTuesday  \n\nAlgorithms-101  \nBST Recursion  \n\n\nWednesday  \n\nAsync-1  \nScope Context-2  \n\n\nThursday\n\nData Modeling-2  \n\n\n\nProjects  \n\nData Structures  \nCallbacks and Data Modeling  \nStart *Book\n\n"},"weeks/04-front-end-developing.html":{"url":"weeks/04-front-end-developing.html","title":"w4 - FE developing","keywords":"","body":"Week theme: better apps and real devving  \nLearning Objectives  \n\nIndividual catch up before moving on to backends  \nBuilding apps from source, Node.js    \nIncorporating libraries and API's  \nPromises 101   \nNext level apps  \n\n\nMonday   \n\nAsync-2  \nNode-2  \nModule Dot Export\nBuilding  \nNpm  \n\n\nTuesday  \n\nDOM-2  \nSh Scripts\n\n\nWednesday  \n\nNo lecture - individual catch-up day \n\n\nThursday  \n\nNo lecture - individual catch-up day \n\n\n\nProjects  \n\nTwitter app  \nTictactoes 2  \nFinish *Book\n\n"},"phases/ph2-backend-express.html":{"url":"phases/ph2-backend-express.html","title":"Part 2 - backend, express","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2 -  Backend Fundamentals, Node.js\nThe second part of this course covers the fundamentals of developing backends with Node.js, Express, Mongo, and Mongoose.
